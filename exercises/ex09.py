# Exercise 5 — Basic Data Analyzer

# Goal: Combine logic, list comprehensions, and built-in functions for a mini data analysis.

data = [4, 7, 10, 2, 9, 4, 3, 8, 4, 6]


# Your task:

# Calculate mean, min, max, and range.

# Count how many values are above the mean.

# Create a new list with only unique numbers, sorted ascending.

# You’ll need: sum, len, max, min, set, sorted, comprehension, and loop logic.
