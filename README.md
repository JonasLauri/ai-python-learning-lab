## AI-Assisted Python Learning 

This repository documents my structured Python learning process — guided and supplemented by AI.  
It combines methodical study with real-time feedback, refactoring, and project-based exercises.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python for scripting, automation, and data engineering workflows.

### What I’ve Learned So Far

#### Stage 1 — Core Python Fundamentals

I’ve built the base layer of Python logic — the foundation every automation, data, and engineering workflow depends on.

**Variables & Data Types**
- Declaring and updating variables  
- Understanding mutability (lists, dicts vs strings, ints)  
- Type conversion and inspection  

**Operators**
- Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators  
- Combining conditions using `and`, `or`, `not`  
- Membership and identity operators: `in`, `is`  

**Conditional Logic**
- `if / elif / else` structures  
- Nested and inline (ternary) conditions  
- Truthy and falsy values  

**Loops**
- `for` and `while` loops for repetition  
- `break`, `continue`, `pass` for control flow  
- Looping through lists, ranges, and dictionaries  
- Using `enumerate()` and `zip()` effectively  

**Data Manipulation**
- Filtering and aggregating lists of dictionaries  
- Built-ins like `sum`, `len`, `max`, `min`, `round`  
- List comprehensions and generator expressions  
- Handling division safely (`ZeroDivisionError`)  

**Conceptual Additions**
- Using `lambda` and functional patterns (`max(..., key=...)`)  
- Writing clean, refactored, and readable code  
- Building data-processing logic that resembles real analytics scripts

### Goals
- Build a solid foundation in Python syntax and logic  
- Practice clean, readable, and reusable code patterns  
- Learn through AI-guided study and feedback loops  
- Prepare for automation and data analysis workflows
