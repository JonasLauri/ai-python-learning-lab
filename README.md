## AI-Assisted Python Learning

This repository documents my structured Python learning process — guided and supplemented by AI.
It reflects the practical fundamentals I’ve mastered before moving into real scripting and project-based development.

The goal: build a strong foundation for automation, scripting, and engineering workflows.

##

### What I’ve recovered So Far

#### Stage 1 — Core Python Fundamentals

**Variables & Data Types**
	•	Assigning and updating variables
	•	Mutability vs immutability (lists/dicts vs strings/ints)
	•	Type conversion, casting, and inspection

**Operators**
	•	Arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment
	•	Combining conditions (and, or, not)
	•	Membership and identity (in, is)

**Conditional Logic**
	•	if / elif / else branching
	•	Nested conditions
	•	Inline (ternary) expressions
	•	Truthy / falsy handling

**Loops**
	•	for and while loops
	•	Loop control: break, continue, pass
	•	Iterating over lists, dictionaries, ranges
	•	Using enumerate() and zip() for cleaner iteration

**Data Manipulation**
	•	Filtering and aggregating lists of dictionaries
	•	Using built-ins (sum, len, max, min)
	•	List comprehensions and generator expressions
	•	Safe handling of division and edge cases

**Functional Logic & Code Quality**
	•	lambda expressions and functional patterns (key= usage)
	•	Writing readable, modular, refactored code
	•	Separating logic, validation, and error handling
	•	Building small functional components that mimic real automation tasks

##

#### Completed Exercises

**Exercise — File Organizer Simulation**
	•	Grouped files dynamically using dictionaries
	•	Detected types using extension checks
	•	Practiced conditionals and data shaping
	•	Generated structured output
	•	Strengthened dynamic data-structure thinking

**Exercise — Text Processing Function**
	•	Added validation with custom error messaging
	•	Used regex to clean and normalize text
	•	Split logic into validation → processing → output
	•	Practiced raising/handling ValueError cleanly
	•	Reinforced clean functional design

##

**Why This Repository Exists**
	•	To record the fundamentals before moving into automation scripting
	•	To document progression, not build a full project
	•	To serve as a base reference for patterns I’ll reuse
	•	To mark the completion of core Python logic

##

#### Next Steps

Learning continues in new project repositories:
	•	File I/O (reading/writing files)
	•	Directory automation (organizing, renaming, scanning)
	•	CLI-style scripts and arguments
	•	Modular project structure
	•	More advanced data processing logic

I have already moved the Expense Tracker and other practice projects into separate repositories where the next learning phase will continue.
