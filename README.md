# Python Learning Journey — supplemented by AI learning workflow

This repository documents my personal Python learning process — guided and supplemented by AI.  
The goal is to combine structured study with real-time feedback, refactoring, and project-based exercises.  
It covers both the technical fundamentals and practical problem-solving workflow for automation, data analysis, and engineering.

## What I’ve Learned So Far

**Stage 1 – Core Python Fundamentals**
- Variables & Data Types  
- Operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment)  
- Conditional Logic (`if / elif / else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, and loop control statements)  
- Working with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets  
- Data manipulation using built-in functions (`sum`, `len`, `max`, `min`)  
- Writing cleaner code with list comprehensions and generator expressions  
- Using `lambda` and `key` functions (e.g., `max(..., key=lambda x: ...)`)  
- Safe coding (handling division by zero, rounding results)

## Goals
- Build a solid foundation in Python syntax and logic  
- Practice clean, readable, and reusable code patterns  
- Learn through AI-guided study and feedback loops  
- Prepare for automation and data analysis workflows
